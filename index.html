                            <p>As mathematics is both a science and an art, Music is both an art and a science. ... Science teaches us that sound is vibration, and the frequency of vibration is what makes different sounds. Music then is the study of the sound created by those vibrations, and puts them into patterns that elicit emotion.</p>

                                <p>Sound shapes the universe as sound is a vibration, a frequency, and we now know from quantum physics that the whole universe is made up of energy fields and technically vibrational fields of energy. Therefore, everything in the universe is made up of vibrations including our physical bodies. What is sound? Sound is a vibration, a specific frequency. As Pythagoras said, “A stone is frozen music”.</p>
